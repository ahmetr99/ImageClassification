# Fashion MNIST Image Classification

This project demonstrates a simple image classification pipeline using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization using standard deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used is [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), a more modern alternative to the classic MNIST dataset. It contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

Each image is 28x28 pixels, representing one of the following clothing items:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Objectives

- Load and visualize the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Normalize and prepare the data for training
- Build and train a basic neural network using Keras
- Evaluate the model’s performance on test data
- Visualize classification results and model accuracy

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

- The trained model achieves approximately 88–92% accuracy on the test dataset.
- Misclassified images and confusion matrix visualizations help identify model weaknesses and interpret results.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook
2. Open `fashion_mnist_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells in order to train and evaluate the model
